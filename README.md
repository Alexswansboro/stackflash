## Setup for development

After cloning the repo, you need to install all dependencies by running:

```
yarn install
```

You then need to make a `.env` file. This file sets up environment variables used in configuration. A sample one is provided at `.env.sample`. You can copy that to `.env`.

## Running the app

To start the app, run:

```
yarn start
```
